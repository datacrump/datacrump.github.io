It was the first time I wrote something into a database and used query language to pull data out. At that time I didn't know what over years of being a software engineer I would always circle back to my true passion - Data Engineering. \n> By the way, my first program didn't have any SQL injection prevention...\n\nI started my professional career as a Visual FoxPro developer\n> not sure if it still exists... \n\nIt was an accounting application and I was creating custom reports for our customers - I think by today's standards we would call such people Data Analysts.\n\nOver the years I was working on multiple different projects mainly in the e-commerce field. The job was fine however I never felt really happy or fulfilled.\n\n> All this changed after I was hired by the travel search company.  \n\n## from software engineer to data engineer\nOne day in our stand-up meeting my manager asked if someone could pull some reports from our data lake. I said I would like to do it and from that day forward my professional life has changed. I wasn't a software engineer anymore\n\n## today\nToday I continue my work as a person of Data Engineering I love this field and everything about it. \n\n## whoami\nMy name is Arturas, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arturastutkus/), nice to e-meet you.\n\nI hope you will find the project interesting enough to follow.\n","top":true,"visible":true},{"fullPath":"/random/hellow-world","categorySlug":"random","slug":"hellow-world","title":"Hello world","excerpt":"Hello world - let me introduce you to Data Crump.
