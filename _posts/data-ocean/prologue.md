## real reason for blog

Before starting this blog, first I came up with this project. Initially, my idea was to put each step of the project as a Medium or LinkedIn post however I decided to move with a custom blog.


## what kind project

I always try to put myself out of my comfort zone - this way I can learn new skills and practices. Most important I get first-hand experience by trying instead of relying upon something I read.  

[Satish Chandra Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scgupta/) have wrote article in which he presented this diagram

I'm pretty sure you have already seen it. This diagram shows how each provider has its own unique service to create a data platform.

AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure have the readiest services for data platforms. Azure and Google use their own solutions, AWS sometimes uses open-source projects as the backbone of their managed services.

There is a lot of information and ideas on how to build the best data platform using these providers. 

My project is a Data platform built on top of Digital Ocean infrastructure.


## choosing name

Digital Ocean + Data Platform:

 * Digital Data / Data Digital
 * Digital Platform / Platform Digital
 * Ocean Data / Data ocean
 * Ocean Platform / Platform Ocean

> I have heard term data river having in mind data streams.

So clear winner for this was Data ocean 

> It has data and a water element in the name :) I am still not sure why data engineers is so obsessed with water 


## data ocean

I will use the infrastructure of Digital Ocean with a combination of open-source projects to make it work. I'm planning on implementing the following.

I do not have a clear plan for each of these pieces, so if you have some ideas, leave your comment on social media.


## summary

I'm very hyped about this project I think it will be enjoyable to execute and also I should learn a ton!!!

If my dear reader you have some requirements or suggestions or applications please don't hesitate and share them on social media.
