## twenty years in computer science
About twenty years ago I wrote an application that used MySQL. It was the first time I wrote something into a database and used query language to pull data out. At that time I didn't know what over years of being a software engineer I would always circle back to my true passion - Data Engineering. 
> By the way, my first program didn't have any SQL injection prevention...

I started my professional career as a Visual FoxPro developer
> not sure if it still exists... 

It was an accounting application and I was creating custom reports for our customers - I think by today's standards we would call such people Data Analysts.

Over the years I was working on multiple different projects mainly in the e-commerce field. The job was fine however I never felt really happy or fulfilled.

> All this changed after I was hired by the travel search company.  

## from software engineer to data engineer
One day in our stand-up meeting my manager asked if someone could pull some reports from our data lake. I said I would like to do it and from that day forward my professional life has changed. I wasn't a software engineer anymore

## today
Today I continue my work as a person of Data Engineering I love this field and everything about it.
